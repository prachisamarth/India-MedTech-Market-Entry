# India Market Entry Strategy — Cardiac Diagnostic Devices

A strategic assessment to help a European MedTech company decide whether and how to enter India's cardiac diagnostics market.



# What Problem Was I Solving?

A European company that makes cardiac diagnostic devices for hospitals and cath labs wanted a clear answer before committing to India:

- Is India worth entering?
- Who actually makes the buying decision in Indian hospitals?
- What is the smartest way to enter — and in what order?



# How I Approached It

I used two types of research together.

First, I looked at publicly available market data — disease trends, hospital infrastructure, competitor activity to understand the overall opportunity.

Second, I designed a primary research plan. A structured set of interviews with the real people who influence device purchases in Indian hospitals: cardiologists, procurement managers, cath lab engineers, and key opinion leaders. This part answers what market reports can't tell you.



# What the Data Showed

India is a large and growing market. The cardiac devices market was valued at USD 2.2 billion in 2024 and is expected to nearly double by the early 2030s. Cardiovascular disease causes roughly 27% of all deaths in India , making cardiac diagnostics a stable, long-term demand category, not a trend.

But it is not a simple market to enter.Price sensitivity is very high. Sales cycles are long — typically 6 to 12 months from first conversation to purchase. And success depends heavily on winning over the right clinicians before procurement even gets involved.

Hospitals drive the majority of demand** — over 70% of the market comes from hospitals and cath labs, concentrated in metro cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore.


# Who Actually Makes the Decision

This is the most important thing a foreign company gets wrong about India. It is not one person — it is a chain.

The cardiologist or Head of Department identifies the clinical need and shortlists devices based on performance and ease of use. They are the most important person to win over first.

The hospital purchase manager controls the budget. They care about return on investment, financing options, and vendor reliability — not clinical specifications.

The cath lab manager or biomedical engineer checks whether the device can actually be installed and used in their specific environment. They care about compatibility, training, and after-sales support.

KOL cardiologists — senior, well-published doctors — influence what their peers adopt. A single KOL endorsement can open multiple hospitals.

# The key insight: winning the cardiologist gets you shortlisted. Winning procurement gets you purchased. You need both.


# The Competitive Landscape

Three types of competitors dominate the market.

Global premium players like GE Healthcare, Philips, and Siemens have strong clinical credibility and brand recognition, but their pricing limits them mostly to top-tier metro hospitals.

Asian mid-priced players like Mindray and Schiller offer competitive pricing and strong distributor networks, giving them wider reach across hospital tiers.

Indian manufacturers compete on low cost and are preferred by price-sensitive hospitals.

The gap in the market — the white space — is a clinically credible, reasonably priced offering with reliable local service support. A European company that can position itself here, rather than competing head-on with GE on brand or Indian manufacturers on price, has a realistic path.



# Recommended Entry Strategy

# Phase 1 — Start focused, not broad (Year 1)

Target private hospital chains in 3 metro cities: Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore. Run pilots in 8 to 10 flagship hospitals. Use a direct sales model — not distributors — because complex cardiac devices need hands-on clinical training and close engagement to build trust. This phase is about generating proof, not volume.

# Phase 2 — Scale using that proof (Year 2 onwards)

Once clinical evidence and reference sites are established in metros, expand into Tier 2 cities like Ahmedabad, Coimbatore, and Kochi using distributors. Tier 2 hospitals watch what metro hospitals adopt — the Phase 1 proof does the selling for you in Phase 2.




# What Primary Research Would Confirm

Before finalising the entry plan, these questions need field validation through actual interviews:

Do Indian cardiologists genuinely pay a premium for European clinical validation, or do they treat it as a baseline expectation?

What price thresholds are acceptable at different hospital tiers?

How much do after-sales service and uptime reliability actually influence the final purchase decision?

Which specific diagnostic features matter most clinically versus which are nice-to-have?
